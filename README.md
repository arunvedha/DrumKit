# DrumKit

The way this website works is that it has got a number of keys here that represent different drums in
a typical drum set.When you click on any of these buttons then you'll get the corresponding sound of the drum.
In addition you can also use the keys on the keyboard.

This website has been implemented using HTML,CSS,JS and uses DOM to dynamically access and update the content, structure, and style of the website.
